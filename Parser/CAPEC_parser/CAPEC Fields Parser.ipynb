Guided by [CWE Introduction notebook](https://github.com/sailuh/perceive/blob/master/Notebooks/CAPEC/Introduction/capec_introduction.ipynb), this notebook will focus on the detail structure under attack pattern table and how parser functions work within the attack pattern table. \n",

The 3-step pipeline contains the following steps: searching XML Field node location, XML field node parser, and exporting the data structure to the output file based on the semantic format in Section 4 of CAPEC Introduction Notebook. More details will be explained in Section 2."

    "\n",
    "Section 2.1 explains the way to search XML field nodes with the target field tag. No matter parsing which field, the first step is to use Xpath and then locate all XML field nodes with the field tag we are intended to parse. The function in section 2.1 has been tested for all fields and thus can locate XML nodes with any given field naming, except Summary under Description node. If parsing Summary, please make change for the Xpath.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 2.2 explains the way to parse and extract the content of the target field into the representation in memory. Since different fields have various nested structures in xml raw file and the content we will parse varies field by field, the worst situation is that there will be one parser function for each different field. However, from Section 4 in CAPEC Introduction Notebook, certain fields may share a same format on website, such as table or bullet list, the ideal situation is that we would have only 4 or 5 functions to represent the data in memory. \n",

    "Section 3 addresses the way to export the data representation from Section 2.2. A set of functions in Section 3 should be the number of data structures in Section 2.2."
