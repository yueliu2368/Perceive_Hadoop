    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to document research and analysis done on the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) for the ultimate goal of creating a corpus for PERCEIVE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "CAPEC displays its data in two formats: the [CAPEC Website](http://capec.mitre.org/) and the CAPEC XML file.  The CAPEC 2.9 XML file used and its accompanying XML Schema Documentation are both available for download on the website [CAPEC website](http://capec.mitre.org/data/index.html) under \"Release Downloads.\" \n",
    "The representation of the data on the [website](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html) is easier to navigate and easier to make sense of than the XML file.  The website's interface for the Views allows you to easily explore through the developed hierarchical relationships due to the (+) and (-) buttons that allow you to expand the relationships. For this reason, we use the website to gather general information, but rely on the XML file, which contains the bulk of the infomation in a convenient machine-readable form to gather the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial examination of the file, we found that the XML contained four root nodes: Views, Categories, Attack Patterns, and Environments.  Each of these root nodes contained subnodes, which we refer to as individual **Entries**.  These Entries have identification numbers and contain numerous subnodes of their own, which we call **Fields**.  These Fields contain the organized information regarding the Entry and are the main focus of our investigation.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the CAPEC Website is significantly easier to navigate than the XML file.  However, the website does not document the hierarchical rules explicitly.  As a result, we observed the hierarchical relationships and created the following diagram to provide such documentation to aid us in solidifying our understanding of those rules.\n",

    "CAPEC entries may have relationships among themselves based on Views, which comprise the highest hierarchical level, as well as relationships to other entries in other levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two Views are Mechanisms of Attack Domains of Attack.  Category Entries have  *MemberOf*  relationships to and are separated based on these views depending on whether they pertain to mechanisms employed in exploiting a vulnerability or the domains on which the attacks are perpetrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below Category Entries are the Attack Pattern Entries;   It is important to note that there are three types of Attack Pattern Entries: Meta, Standard, and Detailed.  These three terms refer to the level of abstraction in the particular Attack Pattern Entries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Meta Attack Pattern Entries are directly below Category Entries in the hierarchy and have the *MemberOf* relationship to these Categories.  As the Categories are ways of sorting Attack Patterns, a given Meta Attack Pattern Entry will be a *MemberOf* two categories, one for each View.  Meta Attack Pattern Entries have *Child* nodes that can be either Standard or Detailed Attack Patterns.  These two abstraction types of Attack Patterns do not have a relationship to the Categories.  Standard Attack Pattern Entries may also have their own Child, which will always be a Detailed Attack Pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that Views and Categories are primarily methods of organizing Attack Patterns, we are specifically interested in the Attack Patterns and the Fields that they contain.  To prepare for extracting information from the text within the Attack Pattern Fields, we must first determine which Fields appear the most, if the most frequent Fields even contain the most important/relevant pieces of information, and the means by which to extract the information from the XML needed to create a corpus."

    "# Parsing the XML File\n",

    "As noted in the introduction, we must determine which fields are the most frequently used among Attack Pattern Entries.  The following Python script uses a list of Fields used by the XML which was created through examining the XML's schema documentation and counts the Fields mentioned to return their frequencies in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encountered a special case within the XML representation where the fields **Summary** and **Attack Execution Flow** were under a container **Description** and would not be counted, despite appearing as unique fields on the HTML representation.  Although there was a **Summary** field in every **Description**, this was not the case for **Attack Execution Flow** and provided an inaccurate representation of the data.  As such, the script takes the **Description** tag as a special case and extracts its children instead.  \n",

    "Since our ultimate goal is creating a corpus using the content contained in the fields of the Attack Pattern entries, it is therefore important that we explore what type of information is provided by each field type.  Below is a table that lists the fields that occur more than 50 times as well as a description of what information CAPEC provides inside those fields.  Our descriptions are based off of the [schema documentation](https://capec.mitre.org/documents/schema/schema_v2.7.1.html).  Most entries in this table are taken directly from the documented description, with a few minor changes to increase understandability, while others have been reworded for effectiveness."
